# Smart Temperature and Humidity Sensor
🌟 Overview
This project is a smart IoT-based temperature and humidity monitoring system designed to provide real-time environmental data for homes, offices, greenhouses, or industrial spaces. Using a microcontroller (like Arduino or ESP32) and a DHT11 or DHT22 sensor, the system continuously measures temperature and humidity, then sends the data to a web dashboard or mobile app for easy monitoring.

It’s perfect for anyone looking to explore IoT, sensor integration, and real-time data visualization!

🚀 Features
✅ Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring
✅ Displays data on a local web server or cloud dashboard
✅ Sends alerts when thresholds are crossed (optional)
✅ Low power consumption
✅ Expandable with additional sensors (light, air quality, etc.)
✅ Easy-to-use, beginner-friendly code

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements
ESP32 / ESP8266 / Arduino Uno (or compatible microcontroller)

DHT11 or DHT22 temperature & humidity sensor

Jumper wires

Breadboard (for prototyping)

(Optional) Wi-Fi connection for cloud/web dashboard

## 📦 Software Requirements
Arduino IDE or PlatformIO

DHT sensor library (Adafruit or similar)

WiFi or HTTP/MQTT library (if using web/cloud)

(Optional) Web dashboard (ThingSpeak, Blynk, or custom server)

## 🔌 How It Works
1️⃣ The microcontroller reads temperature and humidity data from the DHT sensor.

2️⃣ The data is processed and optionally displayed on a local LCD or serial monitor.

3️⃣ If Wi-Fi is enabled, the microcontroller sends the data to a web server or cloud platform using HTTP or MQTT protocols.

4️⃣ The user can view the real-time data on a dashboard or receive alerts when predefined thresholds (like high temperature or low humidity) are crossed.

## 🧩 How to Set Up
1️⃣ Connect Hardware
Connect DHT sensor VCC → 3.3V / 5V (check your microcontroller)

Connect DHT sensor GND → GND

Connect DHT sensor DATA → Digital pin (e.g., D4 on ESP32)

2️⃣ Flash Code
Clone this repository

Open the code in Arduino IDE

Install the required libraries

Update Wi-Fi credentials (if using web/cloud)

Upload to the microcontroller

3️⃣ Test
Open Serial Monitor to check readings

(Optional) Check the web dashboard or cloud platform

## ⚙️ Configuration
In the code, you can configure:

Sampling interval (how often data is read)

Wi-Fi SSID and password

Server or MQTT broker details

Temperature/humidity thresholds for alerts

## 📈 Future Improvements
Add data logging (store data in SD card or cloud)

Integrate more sensors (light, CO₂, air quality)

Build a mobile app for easier access

Use battery + solar panel for outdoor use

Add machine learning to predict environmental changes
